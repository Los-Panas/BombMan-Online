# RGBOOM!
RGBoom! is an online game developed by 4 students of the CITM (UPC).

The game is a mixture of the traditional BomberMan and Splatoon.

## GAMEPLAY
In RGBoom! players must place as many bombs as they can across the map. 
These bombs leave a trail of paint on the ground when they explode. 
If the explosion of the bomb touches you, you die and cannot continue playing. 
During the game different power ups appear that will benefit you.
Once the game is over, the player with the largest painted floor area wins.
